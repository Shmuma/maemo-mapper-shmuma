      <para>
        When you first start Maemo Mapper, you will be presented with the
        <display_text>Settings</display_text> dialog box.  Most of the
        settings have reasonable defaults, but if you have a GPS receiver,
        you should fill in the <display_text>MAC</display_text> field with
        the MAC address of your GPS receiver.  If you don't know the MAC,
        turn on your GPS receiver and push the
        <display_text>Search</display_text> button.  Maemo Mapper will
        attempt to automatically discover the MAC address of your receiver.
        For more information about the <display_text>Settings</display_text>
        dialog box, see <ref refid="help_maemomapper_settings"
          refdoc="Settings"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you are finished setting up Maemo Mapper to your preferences,
        pressing the <display_text>Ok</display_text> button will lead you to
        another dialog box: the <display_text>Manage
          Repositories</display_text> dialog.
      </para>
      <para>
        To get started quickly, press the
        <display_text>Download...</display_text> button.  Maemo Mapper will
        download a set of pre-defined repository information for you to use.
        If you use the pre-defined repositories, you can delete the
        <display_text>Default</display_text> repository.  For more
        information about repositories and the <display_text>Manage
          Repositories</display_text> dialog, see
        <ref refid="help_maemomapper_repoman"
          refdoc="Managing Repositories"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Certain repositories (most notably, the commercial ones) may have
        license agreements attached with their use.  It may be illegal to
        use a certain repository with Maemo Mapper or under certain
        conditions.  This includes the repositories downloaded via the
        <display_text>Download...</display_text> button.  If you are not
        sure if you are legally allowed to use a particular repository, you
        should delete it from your list of repositories.  The authors of
        Maemo Mapper cannot be held responsible for your use of a particular
        repository.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once you have your Repositories set up the way you like, press the
        Ok button, and you will be presented with a blank screen, because
        you have not yet actually downloaded any map data to your device.
        To allow Maemo Mapper to automatically download map data as it
        becomes needed on the display, enable the
        <display_text>Auto-Download</display_text> checkbox in the
        <display_text>Maps</display_text> menu.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you have a working internet connection, Maemo Mapper will attempt
        to download maps and display them on the screen automatically as
        the downloads complete.  You should see a map of the world.  Be
        careful when you enable Auto-Download, because it can quickly fill
        your available disk space.  See
        <ref refid="help_maemomapper_mapman" refdoc="Managing Maps"/> for
        details on how to manage disk space for a particular repository.
      </para>
      <heading>The Graphical User Interface</heading>
      <para>
        The main view of Maemo Mapper emphasizes simplicity.  By default,
        the map is all that is displayed.  You current position (if you have
        a GPS receiver) is indicated by a blue circle.  The blue line
        extending from the blue circle indicates your current heading and
        speed.  <i>Tracks</i> are red and represent where you have been.
        <i>Routes</i> are green and represent where you want to go, i.e.
        directions to a location.

      <para>
        You can also pan around the map by tapping on the screen.  Maemo
        Mapper will center the display on where you tapped.  If you had
        <display_text>Auto-Center</display_text> enabled, tapping a location
        to center on it will automatically disable that functionality.
      </para>
      <para>
        From this point, you can use the menus to manage routes, tracks, and
        map data; to change the view; to change settings; or to see detailed
        GPS information (if you have a GPS receiver).
      </para>
      <para>
        There is also a context-sensitive menu that appears on the map when
        you tap and hold a location on the map.  From that menu, you can
        download directions, calculate distances, or add/modify
        Point-of-Interest (POI) data.

        items in Maemo Mapper.
      </para>
      <heading>Route</heading>
      <para>
        The <display_text>Route</display_text> menu is used to manipulate
        the current <i>route</i>.  A route in Maemo Mapper is defined as a
        set of points and waypoints describing <i>where you would like to
          go</i>, e.g. driving directions from 123 Main Street to 456 Elm
        Street.  It can include multiple segments.  The current route is
        empty until you open or download a route.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <display_text>Route</display_text> menu has the following menu
        items:
      </para>
      <list>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Open...</display_text> - Open a route from a GPX
          file on the file system.  The opened route is <i>appended</i> to
          the current route, so you can string together different routes
          together to create a trip with multiple destinations.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Download...</display_text> - Download a route from
          the internet.  See <ref refid="help_maemomapper_downroute"
            refdoc="Download Route"/> for more information.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Save...</display_text> - Save the current route to a
          GPX file on the file system.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Show Distance to Next Waypoint</display_text> - Show
          the distance left to be traveled (along the current route) until
          the next waypoint.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Show Distance to End of Route</display_text> - Show
          the distance left to be traveled (along the current route) until
          the end of the current route.  The calculated distance includes
          the distance between breaks in the route (i.e. between the end of
          one route segment and the beginning of another route segment).
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Reset</display_text> - Reset Maemo Mapper's tracking
          of your progress along the current route.  Use this if Maemo
          Mapper loses track of where you are with respect to the current
          route.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Reset</display_text> - Clear the current route,
          effectively replacing it with an empty route.
        </listitem>
      </list>
      <heading>Track</heading>
      <para>
        The <display_text>Track</display_text> menu is used to manipulate
        your current <i>track</i>.  A track in Maemo Mapper is defined as
        a set of points along which you have been traveling, i.e.  <i>where
          you have been</i>.  It can include multiple segments.  Tracks are
        most useful if you have enabled a GPS receiver.  The current track
        is empty until you get at least one valid position point from your
        GPS receiver, and it is appendeded to whenever you stray far enough
        from the last track point.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <display_text>Track</display_text> menu has the following menu
        items:
      </para>
      <list>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Open...</display_text> - Open a track from a GPX
          file on the file system.  In contrast to route data, the opened
          track is <i>prepended</i> to the current track, so if you are
          trying to rebuild previous track data, you must open the tracks
          backward in time (most recent tracks first).
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Save...</display_text> - Save the current track to a
          GPX file on the file system.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Insert Break</display_text> - Artificially insert a
	  break in your current track data.  This simulates the loss and
	  re-acquisition of a GPS fix, and it can be used to track, for
	  example, refueling stops.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Insert Mark</display_text> - Artificially insert a
	  mark with a description in your current track data.  This can be
	  used to mark important landmarks.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Show Distance from Last Break</display_text> - Show
          the distance traveled (along the current track) since the last
          break.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Show Distance from Beginning</display_text> - Show
          the distance traveled (along the current track) since the
          beginning of the track.  The calculated distance includes the
          distance between breaks in the track (i.e. between when a GPS fix
          is lost and later re-acquired).
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Clear</display_text> - Clear the current track,
          effectively replacing it with an empty track.

      <context contextUID="help_maemomapper_repoman"/>
      <para>
        In Maemo Mapper, map data is divided into specific areas called
        <i>repositories</i>.  A repository is a source of map data, each of
        which has its own way of visualizing the Earth.  For example,
        repositories based on street maps typically draw roads as lines and
        buildings as areas, whereas repositories based on satellite data
        draw the Earth as it would appear from space.  There are also
        "hybrid" repositories that overlay street map data on top of
        satellite data, as well as topographical maps that show altitude
        data.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each repository is made up of maps at 16 different zoom levels.
        Zoom Level 0 is the highest resolution (closest to the Earth, i.e.
        "zoomed in"), and Zoom Level 15 is the lowest resolution (furthest
        from the Earth, i.e. "zoomed out").  Not all repositories are
        available at all zoom levels, and some repositories may even produce
        an error (which you can ignore) if you try to download maps at that
        zoom level.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once you have set up at least one repository, you can start
        downloading maps from that repository to your device's file system.
        For details on how to do this, see 
        <ref refid="help_maemomapper_mapman" refdoc="Managing Maps"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can set up any number of repositories in Maemo Mapper, but only
        one can be active at any given time.  The <display_text>Manage
          Repositories</display_text> dialog is accessed via the
        <display_text>Manage Repositories...</display_text> menu item of the
        <display_text>Maps</display_text> menu, and it allows you to add,
        edit, and remove repositories.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <display_text>Manage Repositories...</display_text> has a combo
        box that controls which repository is being viewed and edited.  When
        a repository is selected, the controls below it display the current
        settings, which you can change:
      </para>
      <list>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>URL Format</display_text> - A specially formatted
          string that looks like a URL, but it needs to have at least one
          printf-style substitution strings (like %f or %s).  Normally, you
          must either get these URL formats from the internet
          (www.internettablettalk.com is a good source), or you can use the
          <display_text>Download...</display_text> button in the
          Repositories dialog box to download a sample.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Cache Dir.</display_text> - A directory on the file
          system (either on the device's internal memory, or an external
          memory card) in which maps are stored.  Maps are kept here
          indefinitely (until you delete them), so pick a directory with a
          lot of free space.  You can use the
          <display_text>Browse...</display_text> button to select the
          directory with a graphical file system browser, or you can enter
          the directory manually.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Download Zoom Steps</display_text> - Controls which
          zoom levels should be avoided when automatically downloading maps
          (i.e. Auto-Download is enabled).  The lowest setting (one bar)
          means to download every zoom level.  The highest setting (four
          bars) causes Maemo Mapper to only download every fourth zoom level
          (0, 4, 8, and 16).
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>View Zoom Steps</display_text> - Similar to the
          above-described <display_text>Download Zoom Steps</display_text>
          option, except that it controls how Maemo Mapper behaves when
          zooming.  For example, at two bars, pressing
          <graphic filename="2686KEY_zoom_in"/> causes Maemo Mapper to zoom
          in two levels instead of just one.  Setting this equal to
          <display_text>Download Zoom Steps</display_text> ensures that you
          see all maps at their native resolution.
        </listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <display_text>Double Pixels</display_text> - This forces Maemo
	  Mapper to avoid using the native resolution of any maps, instead
	  using pixel-doubling.  This is useful if your repository's maps
	  contain small, hard-to-read text, and you want to double the size
	  of the images to make them more readable.  This setting can also
	  affect the zoom levels that are downloaded when Auto-Download is
	  enabled.
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <display_text>Next-able</display_text> - This oddly-named option
	  determines whether or not the "Select Next Repository" action
	  (which can be mapped to any of the hardware keys) will be able to
	  select this repository.  When unset, the "Select Next Repository"
	  action will simply skip over this repository.
	</listitem>
      </list>
      <para>
        In addition to the per-repository controls, there are a few buttons

          <display_text>New...</display_text> - Adds a new repository.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Reset...</display_text> - Resets your repository
	  list to the factory default.  This will remove all of your
	  repositories and replace them with the single default repository
	  that comes with Maemo Mapper.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Download...</display_text> - Downloads information
          about several preset repositories, and adds them to your
          repository list.  They will be appended to any existing
          repositories you already have.  They are not read-only - you may
          edit them as you wish.  This is a good way to get started.
        </listitem>
      </list>
      <note>
        Certain repositories (most notably, the commercial ones) may
        have license agreements attached with their use.  It may be
        illegal to use a certain repository with Maemo Mapper or under
        certain conditions.  This includes the repositories downloaded
        via the <display_text>Download...</display_text> button.  If you
        are not sure if you are legally allowed to use a particular
        repository, you should delete it from your list of repositories.
        The authors of Maemo Mapper cannot be held responsible for your
        use of a particular repository.

        Route data can be loaded from GPX files, like the ones provided by
        the GPX Driving Directions web service
        (http://www.gnuite.com/cgi-bin/gpx.cgi).  Or, route data can be

          available if <display_text>Use GPS Location</display_text> is
          enabled, will cause Maemo Mapper to automatically re-download a
          new route if you stray from the route.  Note that you must have a

        <listitem>
          <display_text>Use GPS Location</display_text> - If selected, then

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Use End of Route</display_text> - If selected, then
          the end of the route will be used as the
          <display_text>Origin</display_text>.  This is useful for stringing
          together multiple route downloads into a single route.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Origin</display_text> - If selected, then you must

          "5th and Main, 12151".  In fact, if your route download fails with
          a "Could not generate directions" error message, you can use

      <para>
        In Maemo Mapper, <i>repositories</i> represent sources of map data,
        and <i>maps</i> are just image files (e.g. PNG or JPEG) that are
        drawn onto the screen.  Once you have a repository set up (see 
        <ref refid="help_maemomapper_repoman"
          refdoc="Managing Repositories"/>), you can download maps from a
        repository into a Map Cache, which is just a directory on your
        device's file system.
      </para>
      <para>
        Maemo Mapper downloads maps from the current repository so that they
        can be drawn onto the screen and later recalled from disk, instead
        of downloading a map every time it is needed.  This is called
        <i>caching</i>, and it allows you to use Maemo Mapper even when you
        are not connected to the internet.
      </para>
      <para>
        Because Maemo Mapper downloads maps to your device's file system,
        you must be aware of how much disk space your maps are taking up,
        especially if you enable Auto-Download.
      </para>

        Aside from the Auto-Download functionality, you can also download
        maps manually using the <display_text>Manage Maps...</display_text>
        menu item of the <display_text>Maps</display_text> menu.  The
        <display_text>Manage Maps</display_text> dialog allows you to
        download, overwrite, or delete maps, either by area or along your
        current route.  It contains up to three tabs, all of which control
        which and how many maps are downloaded.

      <para>
        The <display_text>Setup</display_text> tab controls what you what to
        do.  You can download maps (optionally overwriting
        already-downloaded maps) from the current repository to your
        device's file system, or you can delete maps (pertaining to the
        current repository) from your device's file system.  Both of these
        operations can be done either over a rectangular area or along your
        current route.

          <display_text>Download Maps</display_text> - If selected, Maemo
          Mapper will download maps from the current repository to your
          device's file system, for the area you specify.  By default, Maemo
          Mapper only downloads the maps that you don't already have.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Overwrite</display_text> - If selected, then Maemo

        <listitem>
          <display_text>By Area</display_text> - If selected, Maemo Mapper
          will download or delete maps for a particular rectangular area of
          the world, based on the latitude and longitude of an upper-left
          and lower-right corner.  See the <display_text>Area</display_text>
          tab to specify the coordinates.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Along Route</display_text> - If selected, Maemo
          Mapper will download or delete maps along your current route.
          This is useful if, for example, you are about to embark on a trip
          and want to make sure that you have maps for all points along the
          route.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Radius (tiles)</display_text> - If
          <display_text>Along Route</display_text> is selected, then you can
          specify the radius around your route for which maps will be
          downloaded or deleted.  For example, if you specify 4 (the
          default), then Maemo Mapper will download all tiles that are
          within 4 tiles of your route.

        of the world for which maps will be downloaded or deleted.  If
        applicable, the fields are pre-filled with your current and previous
        view center coordinates.  This allows you to graphically choose your
        rectangle by first centering on one corner of the rectangle, then
        centering on the opposite corner, by tapping the screen or by using

      <context contextUID="help_maemomapper_poicat"/>
      <para>
        POI Categories are a means by which you can organize your POIs for
        selective display.  The <display_text>POI Categories</display_text>
        dialog is accessed from the <display_text>View</display_text> menu
        and allows you to enable/disable, add, edit, or delete categories.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each row in the table represents a category.  There are three
        columns displayed for each category:
      </para>
      <list>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Enabled</display_text> - Controls whether or not
          POIs in this category are drawn on the map.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Label</display_text> - A short label to describe the
          category.  This is the name that will be visible when viewing a
          POI.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Description</display_text> - A longer description of
          the category.  This description is not visible anywhere except in
          this dialog; it is only used to get an idea of how the category is
          meant to be used.
        </listitem>
      </list>
      <para>
        Selecting a row in the table and pressing the
        <display_text>Edit</display_text> button will allow you to edit the
        above three attributes of a category, and to delete a category.  You
        can also add a new category by using the
        <display_text>Add</display_text> button.
      </para>
      <note>
        A POI may only be associated with a single category at a time.

      <para>
        The <display_text>Settings</display_text> dialog (accessible from
        the main menu) provides access to a plethora of configurable options
	that control how Maemo Mapper appears and runs.  In addition to the
	tabs, which are described below, there are also two buttons at the
	bottom of the diagram labeled <display_text>Hardware
	  Keys...</display_text> and <display_text>Colors...</display_text>.
      </para>
      <para>
	The <display_text>Hardware Keys...</display_text> button brings up
	another dialog box, which allows you to customize the actions that
	each hardware key causes.  For example, you can map the 
        <graphic filename="2686KEY_esc"/> button to cycle through map
	repositories, giving you quick access to switching among them.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <display_text>Colors...</display_text> button allows you to
        customize the colors that are used for drawing on-map objects.
      </para>
      <heading>GPS</heading>
      <para>
        The <display_text>GPS</display_text> tab tells Maemo Mapper which
        bluetooth device from which to retrieve GPS data.  It is only
        applicable if you have a bluetooth GPS receiver with which to use
        Maemo Mapper.
      </para>
      <para>
        Enter the MAC address in the field provided.  If you don't know the
        MAC address, turn on your receiver and press the
        <display_text>Scan...</display_text> button to select it from a
        list of nearby bluetooth devices.
      </para>
      <para>
        <i>Alternatively</i>, if you are using rfcomm or any other
        file-system-based NMEA input source, you can provide a pathname
        (beginning with a leading slash) such as "/dev/rfcomm1".  In this
        case, Maemo Mapper will read NMEA sentences from the file system
        instead of via bluetooth.
      </para>
      <heading>Auto-Center</heading>
      <para>
        The <display_text>Auto-Center</display_text> tab allows you to
        configure how Maemo Mapper automatically re-centers the display when
        either <display_text>Lat/Lon</display_text> or
        <display_text>Lead</display_text> is enabled from the
        <display_text>Auto-Center</display_text> menu.  The Auto-Center
        feature is most useful in conjunction with a GPS receiver.
      </para>
      <list>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Sensitivity</display_text> - Controls how often
          Maemo Mapper re-centers the display, based on how close your
          position (or the position of your <i>lead</i>) gets to the edge of
          the screen.  When set to a low value, Maemo Mapper will only
          re-center the screen when you are near the edge of the screen.
          When set to the maximum, Maemo Mapper will keep your position as
          close to the center as possible.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Lead Amount</display_text> - When Auto-Center is set
          to <display_text>Lead</display_text>, then Maemo Mapper will keep
          the center of the screen focused on an area in front of you.  When
          driving, this allows you to view more of the road ahead of you.
          The distance in front of you on which the screen is centered is
          based on two variables: your current speed and the value of the
          <display_text>Lead Amount</display_text> option.
        </listitem>
      </list>
      <heading>Announce</heading>
      <para>
        The <display_text>Announce</display_text> tab controls how and when
        Maemo Mapper displays or speaks waypoint information.  When you
        approach a waypoint in your route (defined by the presence of a
        description in the GPX file), Maemo Mapper will pop up a text box
        with the contents of that description.  When downloading routes from
        within Maemo Mapper, the text describes your next action, e.g. "Turn
        left at Main Street.  Go 2.4 miles."
      </para>
      <para>
        As you approach a waypoint, Maemo Mapper will continue to display
        the description of that waypoint, so long as you are within the
        range defined by the <display_text>Advance Notice</display_text>
        option, or until you pass the waypoint.  Because the amount of
        notice is dependent on your speed, it is possible to see the text,
        then slow down to a point where the notice disappears.  This is
        possible, for example, if you are stopped at a red light.  The text
        will reappear when you have picked up enough speed to again break
        the <display_text>Advance Notice</display_text> range.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you have installed <i>flite</i>, which is available in the same
        repository from which you downloaded Maemo Mapper, then Maemo Mapper
        can optionally also speak the same directions that appear on screen.
        Maemo Mapper will only speak the directions once, at the exact
        moment you first reach the distance from the waypoint defined by the
        <display_text>Advance Notice</display_text> option.  The same
        directions are on-screen if you need to reference them.
      </para>
      <list>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Advance Notice</display_text> - Controls how much in
          advance Maemo Mapper begins to provide the waypoint description.
          The exact distance at which Maemo Mapper begins to announce a
          waypoint also depends on your speed, so the value of this option
          can be thought of more accurately in units of time.  At the
          minimum value, Maemo Mapper gives you almost no notice.  At the
          maximum value, Maemo Mapper gives you about two minutes of notice.
          Experiment to find your happy medium.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Enable Voice Synthesis</display_text> - If you have
          installed <i>flite</i>, this option will cause Maemo Mapper to
          speak the description of the next waypoint when you enter the
          range defined by the <display_text>Advance Notice</display_text>
          option.
        </listitem>

      <para>
        The <display_text>Misc.</display_text> and <display_text>Misc.

      </para>
      <list>
        <listitem>
          <display_text>Line Width</display_text> - Controls the thickness

        <listitem>
          <display_text>Keep Display On Only in Fullscreen
            Mode</display_text> - Controls whether or not Maemo Mapper
          should limit its "Keep the display on" behavior to full screen
          mode only.  If disabled, then Maemo Mapper will always keep the
          screen on, as long as you are moving.  If enabled, Maemo Mapper
          will only keep the screen on in full screen mode.
        </listitem>
