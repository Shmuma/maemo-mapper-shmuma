maemo-mapper (2.5-os2006-os2007) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for layered maps.  This support is still very
    experimental, and the potential for crashes is rather large.  Still,
    there is demand for it, so I'm posting it early.  By default, layers are
    disabled, so it should not affect normal users.

maemo-mapper (2.4.2) unstable; urgency=low

 -- John Costigan <gnuite@gmail.com>  Sun, 16 Mar 2008 20:00:00 -0400

 -- John Costigan <gnuite@gmail.com>  Sun, 9 Mar 2008 21:30:00 -0500

  * Fixed bug where Maemo Mapper persists in memory after closing.
  * Added ability to "compact" (aka "reorganize") a map cache database.

 -- John Costigan <gnuite@gmail.com>  Mon, 21 Jan 2008 01:31:00 -0500

maemo-mapper (2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added an in-memory map cache to improve pan performance (thanks to Tim
    Terriberry for the patch).
  * Fixed bug with infinitely repeating auto-route-update error messages.
  * Added option to completely disable all announcements.

 -- John Costigan <gnuite@gmail.com>  Sat, 12 Jan 2008 13:07:00 -0500

maemo-mapper (2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified the build system and the code to support OS2008.  It has been
    tested only the N800.
  * Fixed a refresh bug that would cause Maemo Mapper to appear to hang under
    high CPU load.
  * Fixed bug in initial display of "Establishing GPS Fix" window.
  * Made a first stab at conditionally updating the track based on HDOP.  This
    will probably change a lot before I get it to "feel" right.  I hope I
    don't have to add a preference - we're running out of Settings space!

 -- John Costigan <gnuite@gmail.com>  Tue, 28 Nov 2007 00:25:00 -0500

maemo-mapper (2.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the "set_view_center" method name to "set_view_position" for
    clarity.
  * Added two new signals to the DBUS interface: view_position_changed and
    view_dimensions_changed.
  * Fixed a bug in POI lat/lon handling (closes #1695).

 -- John Costigan <gnuite@gmail.com>  Mon, 26 Nov 2007 21:07:00 -0500

maemo-mapper (2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed GPS interaction to use GPSD exclusively, including the new
    libgpsmgr framework.  This allows Maemo Mapper to automatically find a GPS
    receiver (no need to specify one in Settings, although Maemo Mapper will
    try to prefer the one you specify).  Hopefully, this will also address the
    "hanging" issues that people have been having, and it should also make the
    migration to Chinook easier.
  * Added an initial stab at supporting the internal GPS receiver on the N810.
    Use the "File Path" receiver type with "/dev/pgps" to use the N810's
    internal GPS receiver.  ("/dev/pgps" is now the default.)
  * Added the framework for a DBUS interface, including a single DBUS method
    (set_view_center).  More to come later....

 -- John Costigan <gnuite@gmail.com>  Sun, 25 Nov 2007 16:33:00 -0500

maemo-mapper (2.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "Min. Speed" option in "Auto-Center" tab of "Settings", which allows
    you to specify a minimum speed at which you must be traveling in order for
    Auto-Center (and Auto-Rotate) to activate. (closes #1626)
  * Fixed bug in Browsing for new Map Cache DB files. (closes #1613)

    routes. (closes #1619)

    (closes #1621)

 -- John Costigan <gnuite@gmail.com>  Mon, 12 Nov 2007 21:00:00 -0500

maemo-mapper (2.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the bluetooth receiver interaction to hopefully be friendlier to
    more GPS receivers (particularly Holux).
  * Fixed memory overflow situation when downloading "500 MB" of maps.  Maemo
    Mapper should be able to handle more downloads at a time now, but keep in
    mind that it's not unlimited.  2 GB of downloads is too much.
  * Fixed the spurious straight lines in the drawing of tracks and routes.
  * Fixed bug with not downloading higher-zoom maps when no maps were
    available in the current zoom level and the current zoom level is not a
    downloadable zoom level (per the download zoom steps variable).
  * Fixed crashes that occurred during downloading of many maps at a time.
  * Fixed corruption of GDBM database when downloading many maps at a time.
  * Fixed bugs in detection of next waypoint.

 -- John Costigan <gnuite@gmail.com>  Thu, 4 Nov 2007 23:45:00 -0500

maemo-mapper (2.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Expanded the available zoom levels by four additional zoom steps.  This
    change invalidates previous map databases, so you will have to discard
    your previous map data.
  * Fixed crash that occurred during rapid map auto-download.
  * Tightened up the POI Edit dialog to show more of the POI description.
  * Added "Edit Categories..." buttons in a few more places.

  * Fixed bug in "Along Route" radio button.
  * Fixed bug with repeated internet connection attempts.
  * Fixed bug in update of POI List after Delete from Edit POI dialog.

    drop down box in the "Download POI" dialog.
  * Fixed crash with invalid address in the "Go to | Address" action.
  * Fixed initialization of the POI icon directory name.

    (Save and Open operations still use GPX.)
  * Changed map retrieval to use threads.
  * Changed NMEA retrieval to support GPSD and to use a separate thread.
  * Added POI import, download, browser, and export.

  * Added Pre-cache option to reduce the amount of time that black areas are
    on the screen while in Auto-download mode.
  * Modified the Waypoint Notification Window to use a progress bar; this
    should also fix some of the flicker that used to occur.
  * Improved the robustness of bluetooth receiver error handling (no more
      crashing when out of range).
  * Improved memory utilization.
  * Reorganized the code for greater readability.

 -- John Costigan <gnuite@gmail.com>  Thu, 1 Nov 2007 23:00:00 -0400

    3. fix a speed display bug, allow removing "Downloading maps" banner
       when no connectivity is available.
    4. add input / output capability for various DMS formats.

maemo-mapper (1.4.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added ability to edit latitude and longitude in POI Add/Edit dialog.

    re-center the display). (closes #645)

  * Changed the way dialog boxes are displayed - this might help some of the
    random "crash when I try to open XXX dialog box" crashes.
  * Added the "Go to | Address..." menu item.
  * Added Spanish translation.

 -- John Costigan <gnuite@gmail.com>  Sun, 20 Mar 2007 00:27:00 -0400

    tab a little bit (i.e. moved Info Font Size to Misc. [1]).
  * Added Zoom In/Out buttons to the View menu.
  * Added a scale.
  * Added an About page with version information.
  * Added a "Double Pixels" option for repositories; if enabled, maps will be
    shown at a minimum of double the pixel size, for those who don't want to
    squint.
  * Added a "Next-able" option for repositories, which controls whether or not
    the repository is selectable via the "Select Next Repository" shortcut.

  * Modified timestamp to use GPS time if available.
  * Changed old recursive-make-dir code to just use g_makdir_with_parents.

    routes in Maemo Mapper directly, and an action to set the "current GPS
    location" even if you don't have a GPS receiver.

  * Added menu items to show route- and track-related distances.
  * Added menu item in "View" to show/hide all POIs.

  * Removed dependency on libbluetooth1.

maemo-mapper (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Functionally the same as 0.2.4.  The only difference is that the 1.x
    codeline is 2006 OS-compatible, whereas the 0.x codeline will remain 2005
